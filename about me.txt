I am from a industrial Ural city called Yekaterinburg, was born in 1997, May 13.
I gratuated high-school and a university. My major is Oriental Studies. Chinese economy, to be precise.
Also I took an additional course as an English teacher, got proper certificates.

Now I work as an English teacher. My language skills are quite stuck. Chinese is dug in, needs some serious refreshment.
English better, cuz I practice it at work more or less, all my devices are in English, I search mostly in Englsh.

I have a hobby: animation and editing. I like to watch cartoons, read about it. Sometimes I make some animations and editings myself, even commertial.
Don't mind if once I become kinda motion-design freelancer.

However, this year I truly discovered programming. There're not so many ways to get out of my misery situation, being a poor guy from Russia in 2022, so I tried this one.
I tried a few languages and my choice is JavaScript, or Front-end field in the whole. I like making stuff, especially if it's visible, very especially if could be ANIMATED.
As you can see, I would like to combine my little passion for design, animation, video and Front-End frogramming.

The programming goals for the year of 2022 are as follows, no matter what:
- Learn the basics of HTML
- Learn the basics of CSS
- Learn the basics of JS for frontend
- Dive into some frameworks and libraries like React / Angular
- Practice on a few beginning projects
- Build a mini portfolio website with the demonstration of my skills: connect with successful mini-projects, polish the design and animations, make it work as a real product / attractive ads page
